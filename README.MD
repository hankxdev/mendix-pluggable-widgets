I'm trying to create some [Mendix Pluggable Widgets](https://docs.mendix.com/howto/extensibility/create-a-pluggable-widget-one/). 

>Pluggable web widgets are the new generation of custom-built widgets. These widgets are based on React and use a different architecture than the older custom widgets based on Dojo. With pluggable web widgets, you can develop powerful tools in simple, precise ways. In the first part of this series, you will learn to create a text input widget.

Still ongoing...
